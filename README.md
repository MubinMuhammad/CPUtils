# CPUtils
A tool for competitive programmers. It helps fetch problems from platforms & keep those problem unique.
It helps programmers to no waste time to find a problem they can solve!

### Included Features
For now these are the fetures CPUtils support:
- Get a batch of 10 problems after you solve the first batch of 10.
- Get remainder about the contest that's going to start soon.
- Get problems depending on the platforms. Like: Codeforces, Atcoder, LeetCode etc.
- Get remainder if you don't solve problems often.
- See others solution after you solve one.

### Why the name?
Well, I didn't think too much about the name. The name means Competitive programmers' utility or 
Competitive programming utility. How ever you take it. Though the first 3 letters relates to CPU 
which is not the really a part of the project!
